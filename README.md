# App Template (Cursor)

This is a starter folder for new Cursor-based app projects.

## What you get
- `.cursor/rules/`: your reusable slash-command library (design review, peer review, planning, Excalidraw Mermaid flows, etc.)
- `.cursorrules`: CTO-style system prompt template (customize per project)
- `docs/`: project documentation (architecture, decisions, plans)
- `knowledge/`: ad-hoc notes / context you want the agent to reference

## How to use
1. Copy the folder:
   - Duplicate `app-template` and rename it to your new project name
2. Edit `.cursorrules`:
   - Fill in the TODO fields (project name, stack, providers)
3. Open the new folder in Cursor:
   - File → Open Folder → your new project
4. Use `/` in chat to run rules from `.cursor/rules/`
