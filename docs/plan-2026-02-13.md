# Feature Implementation Plan — Payo Calculator MVP

**Overall Progress:** `0%`

## TLDR
Build a **public, indicative cross-border transfer cost estimator** for Payoneer.
- High-polish UI (Revolut/Wise quality) with animations
- Server-side pricing engine (no fees in frontend)
- 10 corridors, Payoneer→Bank only for v1
- Indicative positioning with clear disclaimers

## Critical Decisions
- **Separation of concerns**: Frontend presents, backend calculates — pricing logic never in client
- **Config-driven pricing**: JSON seed file for MVP, DB-backed later
- **Indicative positioning**: Avoids legal risk; clear disclaimers on every quote
- **FX source**: Static mid-rates for MVP; swap to live feed without UI changes
- **Stack**: Next.js 15 + Tailwind + Framer Motion — fast to ship, great DX, Vercel-deployable
- **UI bar**: Revolut/Wise-level polish — expandable breakdown, currency search, smooth animations

## Tasks

- [ ] 🟥 **Step 1: Project Setup & Foundation**
  - [ ] 🟥 Scaffold Next.js app (done via `create-next-app`)
  - [ ] 🟥 Configure Tailwind with Payoneer brand tokens (colors, fonts)
  - [ ] 🟥 Install Framer Motion
  - [ ] 🟥 Set up project structure (`components/`, `config/`, `lib/`, `types/`)
  - [ ] 🟥 Copy logo SVG to `public/`
  - [ ] 🟥 Add country flag assets to `public/flags/`

- [ ] 🟥 **Step 2: Pricing Engine & Quote API**
  - [ ] 🟥 Define TypeScript types (`QuoteRequest`, `QuoteResponse`, `CurrencyConfig`, `PricingRule`)
  - [ ] 🟥 Create `config/currencies.ts` (10 currencies + metadata)
  - [ ] 🟥 Create `config/pricing.ts` (fee rules, FX markups, ETAs per corridor)
  - [ ] 🟥 Implement `lib/quoteEngine.ts` (calculate fees, apply FX, compute both directions)
  - [ ] 🟥 Implement `POST /api/quote` route
  - [ ] 🟥 Test API with sample requests

- [ ] 🟥 **Step 3: Quote Widget — Core UI**
  - [ ] 🟥 `AmountInput` component (editable amount with currency label)
  - [ ] 🟥 `CurrencySelector` component (dropdown with flag, search, popular section)
  - [ ] 🟥 `QuoteWidget` container (You send / Recipient gets layout)
  - [ ] 🟥 Wire inputs to `/api/quote` with debounce
  - [ ] 🟥 Skeleton loading state during API call

- [ ] 🟥 **Step 4: Quote Widget — Breakdown & Details**
  - [ ] 🟥 `FeeBreakdown` component (expandable, mathematical notation: −, =, ×)
  - [ ] 🟥 `ExchangeRate` component (rate + info tooltip)
  - [ ] 🟥 `EtaDisplay` component (icon + "Should arrive by Tuesday")
  - [ ] 🟥 `Disclaimer` component (intermediary bank warning, indicative notice)
  - [ ] 🟥 Method selector (Bank transfer selected, future methods greyed out)

- [ ] 🟥 **Step 5: Animations & Polish**
  - [ ] 🟥 Framer Motion: expand/collapse fee breakdown
  - [ ] 🟥 Framer Motion: currency change transition
  - [ ] 🟥 Framer Motion: amount recalculation (number counting animation)
  - [ ] 🟥 Tooltip micro-interactions
  - [ ] 🟥 Responsive design (mobile-first)
  - [ ] 🟥 Accessibility pass (keyboard nav, ARIA labels, focus states)

- [ ] 🟥 **Step 6: Landing Page & Integration**
  - [ ] 🟥 Design landing page layout (hero text + widget on right, like Revolut screenshot)
  - [ ] 🟥 Payoneer branding (logo, colors, typography)
  - [ ] 🟥 CTA button ("Get started" / "Send money")
  - [ ] 🟥 Meta tags + SEO basics

- [ ] 🟥 **Step 7: Review & Documentation**
  - [ ] 🟥 Code review pass
  - [ ] 🟥 Update `docs/architecture.md` with any changes
  - [ ] 🟥 Update `knowledge/` if new decisions made
  - [ ] 🟥 Verify disclaimers with legal (placeholder for now)
