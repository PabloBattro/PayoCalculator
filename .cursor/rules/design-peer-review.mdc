# Design Peer Review

Critically evaluate feedback from a senior UI/Front-End designer.

A senior designer has reviewed the current UI/UX implementation and provided feedback below. Important context:

- They have less context than you on product constraints, technical limitations, roadmap priorities, and business tradeoffs
- You are the product/design lead — do not accept suggestions at face value
- Your job is to evaluate each suggestion strategically, not emotionally

Feedback from designer:

[PASTE DESIGN FEEDBACK HERE]

---

For EACH feedback item above:

### Verify the issue/opportunity exists
- Is the problem real in the current UI?
- Is it measurable (usability, clarity, hierarchy, accessibility, consistency)?
- Or is it subjective taste?

### Assess alignment with product goals
- Does this suggestion support the current objective of this page/flow?
- Does it improve clarity, conversion, trust, or usability?
- Or does it optimize aesthetics at the cost of focus?

### Evaluate constraints
- Technical complexity (low / medium / high)
- Impact on design system consistency
- Impact on performance
- Risk of scope creep

### Classify the feedback
- ✅ Valid & High Impact
- ⚖️ Valid but Low Priority
- 🤔 Subjective / Preference-Based
- ❌ Misaligned with current goals

### If valid
- Describe the minimal effective change (not a redesign)
- Define expected outcome (what improves?)
- Add to improvement backlog with priority level

### If not valid
- Clearly explain why
- Reference product rationale, system constraints, or user goals

---

After evaluating all items, provide:

**1️⃣ Confirmed Improvements (Actionable & Aligned)**
- List only high-confidence improvements
- Include impact level (UX clarity, trust, conversion, polish, etc.)

**2️⃣ Deprioritized or Context-Dependent Suggestions**
- Valid ideas but not urgent
- Explain tradeoffs

**3️⃣ Rejected Suggestions (With Rationale)**
- Clearly explain why they are not appropriate now

**4️⃣ Prioritized Action Plan**
- Quick wins (≤ 1h)
- Medium improvements (1–3h)
- Structural improvements (larger refactors)

---

If feedback is vague, request clarification before acting.

**Do not redesign blindly. Optimize intentionally.**
