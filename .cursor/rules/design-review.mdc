# Design Review

Perform a comprehensive UI/UX review of the provided screens. Be thorough but concise.

**Goal:** improve perceived product maturity without changing brand look & feel (palette, tone, general style).

## Check For

- **Visual Hierarchy** — Clear primary/secondary/tertiary emphasis, scanning works, headlines/supporting text balanced
- **Typography** — Consistent scale, weights, line-height, readable line length, no “everything same weight”
- **Spacing & Rhythm** — Consistent paddings/margins, vertical rhythm, alignment, grid discipline
- **Color Semantics** — Colors match meaning (error vs warning vs info), no “error red” used for advisory content, accessible contrast
- **Component Consistency** — Buttons/inputs/cards/badges/callouts share rules (radius, border, shadow, states)
- **States & Feedback** — Hover/focus/active/disabled/loading states present and consistent; no ambiguous states
- **Content Clarity** — Copy supports the UI, labels precise, numbers have context, no placeholder-ish phrasing
- **Navigation & IA** — Page sections ordered logically, clear “what next”, no dead-end scrolling
- **Conversion Readiness** — CTA placement/clarity, progressive disclosure, removes hesitation, trust cues
- **Accessibility** — Keyboard focus visible, contrast OK, tap targets, semantic warnings, reduced reliance on color only
- **Responsiveness** — Layout holds on common breakpoints, no awkward wrapping, density appropriate
- **Performance Perception** — Avoids heavy effects, over-blur, jank-prone shadows, image quality acceptable
- **Design System Fit** — Follows existing patterns/tokens; no one-off styling unless justified

## Inputs

- **Screenshots / URL**: [PASTE HERE]
- **Target user persona**: [Seller / Service Provider / etc.]
- **Primary goal of the page**: [e.g., educate + drive to partner exploration]
- **Constraints**: keep palette, keep style, avoid redesigns

## Severity Levels

- **CRITICAL** — Misleading semantics, accessibility blockers, broken navigation, severe readability issues
- **HIGH** — Bad UX, trust-killers, confusing hierarchy, error/warning misuse, conversion friction
- **MEDIUM** — Consistency gaps, layout rhythm issues, missing states, minor clarity problems
- **LOW** — Cosmetic polish, micro-alignment, small copy tweaks

## Rules

- Don’t propose a full redesign unless necessary — prefer minimal effective changes.
- If feedback is subjective, label it explicitly as **Preference** and still propose a measurable rationale (or skip it).
- Keep suggestions implementable: aim for fixes that a FE dev can apply quickly (tokens, spacing, component variants).
